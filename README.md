# OpenPokerAI 

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/OpenPokerAI/OpenPokerAI/_apis/build/status/MarcFletcher.OpenPokerAI?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/OpenPokerAI/OpenPokerAI/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=main) [![Lines of Code](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=OpenPokerAI_OpenPokerAI&metric=ncloc)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=OpenPokerAI_OpenPokerAI)

## What is it?

This repo contains everything required to train and play against 'reasonably sophisticated' poker AIs. It is shared with the intention of being used as a learning playground for aspiring and also seasoned (if you fancy a change of problem domain) AI/ML engineers and researchers.

## Licensing

This project is released under the terms of the Apache 2.0 License.

## Where does this work come from?

This was one of many side projects by [MattDean](https://github.com/MattDean) and [MarcFletcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcpfletcher/) between 2009 and 2013. Since then we got distracted with life and the code has sat on a shelf ever since.

Back then the field of ML was orders of magnitude less sophisticated than it is today so some of the ML implementations demonstrated here might now be considered out-of-date. Since 2013 we've also learnt a lot about how to create large software projects so please don't judge what still looks like a 'hacky' project, e.g. we don't have many tests which should really exist. We feel it is better to share it sooner in its current form, warts and all, rather than later or never.

## Getting started

TBC - Once enough code has been pushed to make this project playable 'getting started' information will be added here. Right now we're still trying to pull the good stuff out from the many weeds.

Note: If things don't appear to be working check for error log files in your execution environment.
