    ///  * Both the multiplicative and z-axis normalization types allow a group of 
    /// outputs to be adjusted so that the "vector length" is 1.  Both go about it
    /// in different ways.  Certain types of neural networks require a vector length 
    /// of 1.
    /// 
    /// The multiplicative normalization is more simple than Z-Axis normalization.  
    /// Almost always Z=Axis normalization is a better choice.  However, 
    /// multiplicative can perform better than Z-Axis when all of the values
    /// are near zero most of the time.  This can cause the "synthetic value"
    /// that z-axis uses to dominate and skew the answer.
    /// 
    ///  Multiplicative normalization works by calculating the vector length of
    ///  the input fields and dividing each by that value.  This also presents 
    ///  a problem, as the magnitude of the original fields is not used.  For 
    ///  example, multiplicative normalization would not distinguish between
    ///  (-2,1,3) and (-10,5,15).  Both would result in the same output.
