    /// Both the multiplicative and z-axis normalization types allow a group of 
    /// outputs to be adjusted so that the "vector length" is 1.  Both go about it
    /// in different ways.  Certain types of neural networks require a vector length 
    /// of 1.
    /// 
    /// Z-Axis normalization is usually a better choice than multiplicative.    
    /// However, multiplicative can perform better than Z-Axis when all of the 
    /// values are near zero most of the time.  This can cause the "synthetic value"
    /// that z-axis uses to dominate and skew the answer.
    /// 
    ///  Z-Axis gets its name from 3D computer graphics, where there is a Z-Axis
    ///  extending from the plane created by the X and Y axes.  It has nothing to 
    ///  do with z-scores or the z-transform of signal theory.
    ///  
    ///  To implement Z-Axis normalization a scaling factor must be created to multiply
    ///  each of the inputs against.  Additionally, a synthetic field must be added.
    ///  It is very important that this synthetic field be added to any z-axis
    ///  group that you might use.  The synthetic field is represented by the
