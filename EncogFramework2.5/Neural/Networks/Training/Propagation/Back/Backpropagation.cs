    /// that implements the Train interface.
    /// 
    /// Backpropagation is a common neural network training algorithm. It works by
    /// analyzing the error of the output of the neural network. Each neuron in the
    /// output layer's contribution, according to weight, to this error is
    /// determined. These weights are then adjusted to minimize this error. This
    /// process continues working its way backwards through the layers of the neural
    /// network.
    /// 
    /// This implementation of the backpropagation algorithm uses both momentum and a
    /// learning rate. The learning rate specifies the degree to which the weight
    /// matrixes will be modified through each iteration. The momentum specifies how
    /// much the previous learning iteration affects the current. To use no momentum
    /// at all specify zero.
    /// 
    /// One primary problem with backpropagation is that the magnitude of the partial
    /// derivative is often detrimental to the training of the neural network. The
    /// other propagation methods of Manhatten and Resilient address this issue in
    /// different ways. In general, it is suggested that you use the resilient
    /// propagation technique for most Encog training tasks over back propagation.
