FilePersistence.cs - Bug fix in CreateStream(FileMode mode)
Moved to .Net 4.0
Distort.cs - Added support for selective neuron distortion.
MutatePerturb.cs - Added support for selective neuron distortion and multiple mutation factors.
GeneticAlgorithm.cs - Modified implementation of Iteration()
FilePersistence.cs - Added support for direct input of networkXML lines.

GATracker.cs - Genetic Algorithm Tracker used for tracking the children of splices/mutations
	..GATracker is passed down the Genetic Algorithm execution stack so any changes there would also need copying over
