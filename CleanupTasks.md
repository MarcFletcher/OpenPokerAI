# Future Cleanup Tasks 

The following tasks have been spotted during the project migration as benefiting from future cleanup:

- Make class, property and parameter naming consistent. Possibly with the right style rule.
- All style warnings that would preferably be errors, e.g. ensuring braces are always used.
- Add Testing to numeric classes.
- Add integration test for pokergame to make sure all calculations result in the expected answer.
- Removing the Encog project and replacing it with a NuGet dependency.  
- Re-add support for training player action prediction (PAP) models.
